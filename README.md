# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to perform image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch. It includes the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset to classify images into 10 different classes. There were two approaches taken to make the convolutional neural network as well. The first model made (not attached), had a 20% accuracy as it had no convolutional layers. The second model made was able to predict with a 61% accuracy, and third model made was able to predict with a 63% accuracy. 

A Tesla T4 Nvidia GPU was used on Google Colab for this project.
