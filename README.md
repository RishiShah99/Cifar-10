## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a neural network model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. This implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning. It contains 60,000 images categorized into 10 different classes:

1. Airplane
2. Automobile
3. Bird
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Frog
8. Horse
9. Ship
10. Truck

The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

## Model Architecture

The model used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following layers:

- Convolutional layers
- Pooling layers
- Fully connected layers
- Dropout layers

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately XX% on the test set. (Replace XX with your model's accuracy.)

## Modules

To run the code, you need the following modules:

```bash
# Install the required modules using pip
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install torch
pip install torchvision
```
## Usage
Clone the respository and navigate to the project directory: 
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/RishiShah99/Cifar-10.git
cd Cifar-10
```
